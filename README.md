Applying machine learning to the optimisation of numericalintegration in finite element method

## Introduction
The software developed is a novel smart FEM platform which combined machine learning techniques with the traditional deterministic method. To specific mechanics problem, this software is able to provide solutions more efficiently with the same accuracy than the traditional method.

As shown in the figure below, the input of the neural network here is the coordinates value of the element.  Theoutput of the network would be sent to a softmax function( a cross-entropy function).  Then a probabilitydistribution of the possible number of integration points needed is calculated.  The number with the highestpossibility would be chosen as the input number of the tensor quad.
The neural network in the machine learning module can select the optimal number of integration points for numerical integration according to elements shapes. The classification accuracy of the network on unseen data can reach $94.3\%$.

* __data_generation__ - holds the code for generating the data in the 'data' repo

* __elements__ - three kinds of FEM element: 8-node hexahedral, 4-node tetrahedron, 10-node tetrahedron 
 
* __FEM_modules__ - sepsific FEM code for linear elasticity problem
  
* __HPC_scripts__ - the scripts of generating dataset using HPC
  
* __integration_module__ - contains the smart integration method

* __trained_model__  - holds all the machine learning models

* __utils__ - some basic tools 

## Dependencies
To be able to run this software, the following packages and versions are required:

 - Python Version 3.7
 - NumPy Version 1.16.3
 - SciPy Version 1.3.0
 - PyTorch Version 1.1
 - Sikit-learn Version 0.21
 - matplotlib Version 3.1.0

## Test and example
There are four test cases could be executed using very easy bash commands.

- Data generation
This part involves FEM, integration and elements modules. By running the following commands, all mentioned above module could be tested.
```bash
  cd data_generation
  python3 run_generation_tetra.py 
  python3 run_generation_hex.py 
```

- Training process
This part is a test case for neural network training. The lines below are used to retrain a nerural network.
```bash
  cd machine_learning_module
  python3 train.py
```
- Load model
There are two trained models whcih could be use and make predicitons. The following commands help you load and play with test input data.
```bash
  cd machine_learning_module
  python3 load.py
```
